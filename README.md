MeemArduino
===========

This code publishes an Arduino's digital and analog inputs to an MQTT service, and subscribes to the MQTT service 
to update device outputs.

The topics used to send and receive messages represent Meem Facets (refer to Meemplex documentation).

This project is for an Arduino with an ethernet adapter.
